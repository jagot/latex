* Installation
  To use any or all of the above packages, copy or symlink the folders
  as subfolders of =$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex=, where the value of
  =$TEXMFHOME= can be found by
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
  #+END_SRC
  On Linux, this is usually =~/texmf= and on macOS =~/Library/texmf=.
